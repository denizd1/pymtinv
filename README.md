# pymtinv
pymtinv is a Python-based scientific computing library designed for 2D Magnetotelluric (MT) inversion. It serves as a comprehensive research framework to benchmark classical deterministic optimization methods against novel Probabilistic Computing (P-bit) architectures tailored for FPGA acceleration.
